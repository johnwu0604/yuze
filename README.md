## Hack The North Project - Yuze ##

## Inspiration
Having all had experience working in the restaurant industry, we knew that a common scenario is when a customer would walk in and ask for "the usual please". However, we knew that it isn't always that easy to remember every customer's "usual" order. Therefore, we created Yuze.

## What it does
Yuze is a self ordering kiosk that uses face recognition to keep track of all the customer's orders. When a returning customer is recognized, they are immediately given the suggestion to order their usual items instead of having to browse through the full menu.

## How we built it
Yuze was built with a MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular 2, Node) along with integrations of the Microsoft Cognitive Service's Face API and Amazon Web Service's S3 storage service.

## Challenges we ran into
The hardest challenge we faced was trying to integrate the usage of the webcam in a web browser using a modern language (Angular 2) that didn't have much references online compared to other languages.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Finishing a total of 20 cups of coffee within our team of 3 members.

## What we learned
That it is in fact possible for a human to stay awake for 36 hours.

## What's next for Yuze
The idea of Yuze can be very practical in the restaurant industry to improve its customer service. Its customer recognition can be an integration offered to existing self ordering kiosks or it can be a separate revolutionary product on its own.
